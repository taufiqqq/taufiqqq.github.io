Scope of the Project
--------------------

draw.io is a diagramming or whiteboarding application, depending on which theme is selected. It is not an SVG editing app, the SVG export is designed only for embedding in web pages, not for further editing in other tools.

The application is designed to be used largely as-is. draw.io is not suitable as a framework for building other products from. For this try either [Tldraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw) or [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw).

Note, in particular, we don't have support for collaborative editing in this project. If this is important, one of the projects above is likely a better choice.

If you are using a draw.io project/product and have issues or questions about the editor itself, the issue tracker and discussion in this GitHub project are likely a good place to look.

Running
-------

One way to run draw.io is to fork this project, [publish the master branch to GitHub pages](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) and the [pages sites](https://jgraph.github.io/drawio/src/main/webapp/index.html) will have the full editor functionality (sans the integrations).

Another way is to use [the recommended Docker project](https://github.com/jgraph/docker-drawio) or to download [draw.io Desktop](https://get.diagrams.net).

The full packaged .war of the client and servlets is built when the project is tagged and available on the [releases page](https://github.com/jgraph/draw.io/releases).
